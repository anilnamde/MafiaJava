=====================
1. JUnit Overview
=====================
Its testing framework for Java
Writing test with Junit is not just testing but an activity of writing code

1. Junit Feature
    1. Assertion
    2. Test setup & Tear down
    3. Test for exception
    4. Test suites
    5. Parameterized test
    6. Assumptions: to igore test for perticular platform
    7. Rules : to extend function of Junit
    8. Theory : special test run under different context
    9. Interation with build system


2. Where is JUnit Components

Code to test: code to test
Test Code(in JUnit): Class to setup. tear down data
Junit Runner: To run test and return results

3. Unit testing fundamentals:
    1. Take smallest unit of code and test it i.e. class is "unit testing"
    2. If you test more than one class its like "Integration testing". You can also do it with JUnit

4. History
    Kent Beck/Albert Gamma
    1994: Small Talk SUnit
    1997: JUnit flight
    2000: JUnit.org
    2002: Built in Eclips

5. Installation:
    1. Its already in the Eclips
    2. Download junit.jar, hamcrest-core.jar

    1. For testing general setup is
        - One project where actual code is
        - Other project which has all the testing code
